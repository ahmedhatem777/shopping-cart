### Background:

I built this project from the ground up using [React](https://reactjs.org/), it was generated with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), I used [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state-management, and [MUI](https://mui.com/) for the application's design and responsiveness, and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for some animations and transitions, the products are fetched from [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/).
